# API Monitoring via Userland Hooks and Code Injection Detection

## About This Paper

The following document is a result of self-research of malicious software (malware) and its interaction with the Windows Application Programming Interface (WinAPI). It details the fundamental concepts behind how malware is able to implant malicious payloads into other processes and how it is possible to detect such functionality by monitoring communication with the Windows operating system. The notion of observing calls to the API will also be illustrated by the procedure of _hooking_ certain functions which will be used to achieve the code injection techniques.

**Disclaimer**: Since this was a relatively accelerated project due to some time constraints, I would like to kindly apologise in advance for any potential misinformation that may be presented and would like to ask that I be notified as soon as possible so that it may revised. On top of this, the accompanying code may be under-developed for practical purposes and have unforseen design flaws.

## Introduction

In the present day, malware are developed by cyber-criminals with the intent of compromising machines that may be leveraged to perform activities from which they can profit. For many of these activities, the malware must be able survive out in the wild, in the sense that they must operate covertly with all attempts to avert any attention from the victims of the infected and thwart detection by anti-virus software. Thus, the inception of stealth via code injection was the solution to this problem.

## Inline Hooking

Inline hooking is the act of detouring the flow of code via _hotpatching_. Hotpatching is defined as the modification of code during the runtime of an executable image<sup>[1]</sup>. The purpose of inline hooking is to be able to capture the instance of when the program calls a function and then form there, observation and/or manipulation of the call can be accomplished. Here is a visual representation of how normal execution works:

```
Normal Execution of a Function Call

+---------+                                                                       +----------+
| Program | ----------------------- calls function -----------------------------> | Function |  | execution
+---------+                                                                       |    .     |  | of
                                                                                  |    .     |  | function
                                                                                  |    .     |  |
                                                                                  |          |  v
                                                                                  +----------+

```

versus execution of a hooked function:

```

+---------+                           +----------+                    + ------->  +----------+
| Program | ---- calls function ----> |  Hooked  | | execution        |           | Function |  | execution
+---------+                           | Function | | of             calls         |    .     |  | of
                                      |    .     | | hooked         normal        |    .     |  | function
                                      |    .     | | function      function       |    .     |  |
                                      |    .     | v                  |           |          |  v
                                      +----------+  ------------------+           +----------+

```


This can be separated into three steps. To demonstrate this process, the WinAPI function [MessageBox](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms645505(v=vs.85).aspx) will be used.

1. Hooking the function

To hook the function,
